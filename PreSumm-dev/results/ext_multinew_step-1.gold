每 new calculations in the cosmos have revealed a surprise : the universe appears to be expanding faster than anyone thought .<q>using the hubble space telescope , scientists measured the distance to stars in 19 galaxies and concluded that the universe is growing 5 % to 9 % quicker than expected , the researchers say in a press release .<q>for the record , they calculate the rate to be 45.5 miles per second per megaparsec , the latter being the equivalent of 3.26 million light-years .<q>it ＊ s surprising , upi reports , because astronomers expected the calculations to jibe with previous ones conducted by nasa and the european space agency .<q>if the new rate is confirmed , it could challenge some basic precepts about how the universe functions and challenge at least part of einstein ＊ s theory of relativity , reports the guardian .<q>`` if you really believe our number〞and we have shed blood , sweat and tears to get our measurement right and to accurately understand the uncertainties〞then it leads to the conclusion that there is a problem with predictions based on measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation , the leftover glow from the big bang , '' says co-author alex filippenko of berkeley , per the christian science monitor .<q>while 5 % to 9 % may not seem like a big deal , it constitutes a `` major discrepancy '' in this particular case , notes gizmodo .<q>part of the answer around the discrepancy may lie in the `` mysterious parts of the universe that make up 95 % of everything and do n't emit light , such as dark energy , dark matter , and dark radiation , '' says another of the project ＊ s researchers .<q>their findings will be published in astrophysical journal .

每 `` chilling , '' `` unsettling , '' and `` manipulative '' is what critics are saying about gone girl , starring ben affleck and rosamund pike as nick and amy , a husband and wife trying to make it in a small town in missouri〞just the type of descriptors you probably want for a mystery-thriller about what happens when nick becomes a suspect in amy ＊ s sudden disappearance .<q>here ＊ s what the critics have to say : for mick lasalle at the san francisco chronicle , the movie starts off `` brilliant , not just a triumph of story but of strategy , '' and maintains that momentum throughout ＃ until the last 20 minutes .<q>that ＊ s when lasalle says the movie `` frays '' 〞a `` swiss watch of storytelling [ that ] turns into a bad digital clock circa 1986 , flashing the wrong numbers .

'' he also lauds the supporting cast ( including neil patrick harris and tyler perry ) as `` a thing of wonder '' and praises the movie overall as `` that rare entertainment that rewards your intelligence instead of insulting it , that rare thriller interested in emotional wounds as much as physical ones . '' but gone girl is n't as alluring as fincher ＊ s the social network , laments anthony lane in the new yorker , asking : `` who could have predicted that a film about murder , betrayal , and deception would be less exciting than a film about a website ? '' the film that lane at first calls `` natural fincherland '' soon devolves into a movie that `` lacks clout . '' he also ca n't help but note that gone girl is `` meant to inspire debates about whether amy is victimized or vengeful , and whether nick deserves everything he gets , but , really , who cares ?

每 good news for the fair-skinned among us : scientists in massachusetts have developed a drug that darkens and protects human skin without the damaging effects of ultraviolet ( uv ) light .<q>dr .<q>david fisher , a researcher at massachusetts general hospital , tells the bbc the drug initiates a series of chemical reactions that enables skin to produce sun-blocking dark melanin without exposure to dangerous uv light〞which initiates the same chemical reactions , but only after damaging the skin .<q>`` under the microscope it ＊ s the real melanin , § fisher says .<q>※ it really is activating the production of pigment in a uv-independent fashion .

每 what happens when humans abandon 1,600 square miles because of radioactivity ?<q>wildlife runs rampant , apparently .<q>a new study on animals in the chernobyl exclusion zone shows what once looked something like a wasteland is now packed with elk , roe deer , red deer , wild boar , and wolves .<q>researchers conducted aerial surveys in the zone during winter months between 1987〞a year after the chernobyl disaster〞and 1997 and estimated animal populations based on tracks in the snow , reports the guardian .<q>they found the number of animals in the area was actually on par with those in four uncontaminated nature reserves nearby ; but the number of wolves was more than seven times greater than in reserves .<q>the numbers of elk , roe deer , and wild boar also jumped at a time when elk and wild boar populations were sliding elsewhere in the former soviet union .<q>`` it ＊ s very likely that wildlife numbers at chernobyl are much higher than they were before the accident , '' a researcher says in a release .<q>`` this does n't mean radiation is good for wildlife , just that the effects of human habitation , including hunting , farming , and forestry , are a lot worse . '' but another researcher who has studied birds in the zone tells the bbc the research `` only applies to large mammals under hunting pressure , rather than the vast majority of animals〞most birds , small mammals , and insects〞that are not directly influenced by human habitation . '' and since the study did n't look at radiation exposure , it `` does not address the issue of whether radiation has effects on reproduction , survival , longevity , or general health of the animals surveyed . '' while scientists found chernobyl ＊ s wild boar population dipped in 1993 , they say hungry wolves and a disease outbreak were to blame .<q>( there ＊ s something wrong with chernobyl ＊ s forests . )
